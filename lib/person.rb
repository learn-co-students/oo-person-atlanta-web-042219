# First you need to create a person class that is initialized with a name that cannot be changed.
# Each instance of class Personshould be able to remember their name
# Each instance of class Person should start with $25 in their bank accounts
# Each instance of class Person should start with eight happiness points
# Each instance of class Person should start with eight hygiene points
# The happiness and hygiene points should be able to change, however the maximum and minimum points for both happiness and hygiene should be 10 and 0 respectively
# The amount in the bank account should also be able to change, though it has no max or min.
